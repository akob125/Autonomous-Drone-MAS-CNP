# Introduction
The goal of this project is to achieve a collaboration between UAVs to extinguish fire outbreaks in forests and finding a balance between the number of UAV to be deployed and the on-board hardware communication range per UAV using CNP Protocol.

# Multi Agent System
A multi-agent system (MAS) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. They can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent. Intelligence may include methodic, functional, procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning.
Multi-agent systems consist of agents and their environment. Typically, multi-agent systems refer to software agents. However, the agents in a multi-agent system could equally well be robots, humans or human teams. A multi-agent system may contain combined human-agent teams.

# Contract Net Protocol
CNP is a task-sharing protocol in multi-agent systems, consisting of a collection of nodes or software agents that form the `contract net'. Each node on the network can, at different times or for different tasks, be a manager or a contractor.

When a node gets a `composite task' (or for any reason cannot solve the present task) it breaks the problem down into sub-tasks (if possible) and announces the sub-task to the contract net acting as a manager. Bids are then received from potential contractors and the winning contractor(s) are awarded the job(s).



### Requirements
The project was built using NetBeans 8.2 - Java setup on a MAC system.
